When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A remote repository is useful when you are working remotely or with other people
as it allows everyone to access the files to a project easily.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes is recomended as you may be working on something locally and are not ready to be updated with other peoples updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone of a github repository that is saved to your github account, it is useful when you are unable to push to someones original repository. Clone is a copy of either a github repository or a local repository that you can download onto your local computer. A branch is a commit that diveates from the master branch, it is used when experimental code is created but you still want to have a stable build available.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
having the last state of the remote stored locally is good as it allows one to track their progress from the other collaboraters.
